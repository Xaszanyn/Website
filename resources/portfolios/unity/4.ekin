<h3>Escape From Darkness (Game Jam)</h3>

<span class="time">23 May 2021</span>

<p>It's a Run and Jump style game that I made the all musics and visuals by myself in 3 days in the Hackaton Isparta Game Jam.</p>

<p>During this 3-day period, I understood the importance of time planning in game developing, learned using different layers, and realized that different level designs can be created with the flexibility of this color mechanic.</p>

<p>Player tries to escape from the darkness on different platforms by using the colors red, green and blue for can pass through platforms of the same color as itself.</p>
